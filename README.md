Spring Boot â€“ Kafka

Spring Boot + Kafka integration allows you to easily produce (send) and consume (read) messages from Apache Kafka using Spring Kafka.
By using Docker, you can quickly set up and run Kafka and Zookeeper containers without manually installing them on your system, making local development and testing much faster.
You can also integrate MySQL with Spring Boot to store the messages consumed from Kafka, enabling persistent storage, querying, and further processing of your streaming data.
